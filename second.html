    <h1>What is Python</h1>

    <p>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code
        readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented
        approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p>
